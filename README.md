# Voice-conversion

This project is speech-to-speech conversion. We applied StarGAN(Genarative Adversarial Networks) model to the inputs.
We preprocessed the speech, and fed the spectogram to the StarGAN model which was trained for 20,000 epochs.
The original paper suggested 2,00,000 iterations for better performance.
We have added the colab code, results of our model after testing and pre-trained model checkpoints at 20,000 iterations.

We followed this Star-Gan VC paper:
